# Deep Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng) - Solutions

This repository contains my code solutions for the assignments and exercises from the Coursera course:

[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) by Andrew Ng

## Structure

- Each folder (e.g., `W2A1`, `W2A2`, `W3A1`) corresponds to a specific week and assignment in the course.
- Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts contain my implementations, tests, and results for the exercises.
- All code is written and organized for educational purposes and personal reference.

## Note

- Please do not copy solutions directly for submission. Use these as a reference to aid your own learning.
- All datasets and utility files are provided as part of the original Coursera assignments.

Happy learning!
